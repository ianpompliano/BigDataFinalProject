"""The Ballad of the Green Berets""",protest music cause political event vice versa two must first related society politics music related fundamentally song discus politics political ideal existed society since long vietnam war first era politically focused music expanded beyond niche audience widespread popularity addition protest musician close relationship protest movement whole allowed reach broader audience greater effect relationship music politics evidenced existence song dealing political topic vietnam war common song discussing union labor movement aught hold common greedy parasite would lash serfdom would crush might anything left organize fight union make strong example come song solidarity forever written performed pete seeger song give direct political commentary employer union one subtle hidden song argues union must formed combat greed employer belief line labor movement time show tradition protest song vietnam war another protest song protest racism societal injustice even noble properly handled ladder law top bottom stared person killed reason handed penalty repentance william zanzinger six month sentence song protest racism within justice system telling story black woman killed white man later receives six month sentence murder song released provides example song mid sixty using specific event protest social problem racism argue reform example show political belief incorporated music despite popularity gained political protest song new occurrence protest song popular protest song previous decade political music existed protest song often appealed small group within society reason much protest music especially regarding labor movement reach widespread popularity protest song enjoyed sixty example pete seeger shown indicative political song labor movement designed call arm union member used strike rally result little appeal setting nonunion member effect limiting applicability song decreasing widespread popularity limited popularity protest music reversed reversal result political event vietnam war draft important entire nation contrast labor movement really important industrial worker factory owner modern system music distribution vietnam war gave protest music greater importance listener even song explicitly discus war addition music much efficient distribution system previously available radio distributed song throughout entire country cheap vinyl record allowed listener access greater variety music addition music chart like billboard top later american top consolidated song played across country single mainstream music culture allowed song easily distributed across entire country giving huge audience widespread radio play factor let protest song enter primarily pop music chart spread political commentary idea example barry mcguire song eve destruction reached number one hot music chart song gave description war chaos atomic age stating modern society yet realized eve destruction similarly ssgt barry sadler ballad green beret reached number one chart remained six week song reaction protest vietnam war patriotically described green beret intention raising patriotic sentiment support war prove political protest song listened appreciated political meaning show song political message vietnam war wide radio play mean would played across country liked least musically many ultimately mean large number people would heard song least exposed political message addition popularity protest music close relationship overall protest movement especially protesting war draft furthering tie politics music evidence shown construction large music festival woodstock music festival like featured artist like country joe fish whose song feel like fixin die rag directly protested vietnam war draft jefferson airplane whose volunteer advocated complete overthrow current social order listener pay see music festival would likely familiar music band playing would like music would likely agree idea expressed music addition many people attending concert student protester music festival filled young people led student protest university featured artist led creation protest music support sometimes went beyond political view example monterey international pop festival music festival california nearly performer would play free proceeds slated youth friendly cause case artist support political protest movement go beyond ideological support protester monetarily supporting thing broadly protest musician also wrote song student protest firmly sided protester supporting action condemning trying stop protest example buffalo springfield describes protest song worth saying young people speakin mind gettin much resistance behind step line man come take away give example protest song describes student protest siding protester made much musical audience protest music defined music discus protest current social political state protest music political music reached wider popularity enjoyed time addition radio vinyl allowed protest music distributed widely emphasized political effect however protest music caused politics time protest music effect influencing creating political event issue argued way although dominant theory politics caused protest music secondary theory argues protest music caused political event however relationship music politics vietnam war era deeply intertwined neither proven caused dominant view causality protest music politics protest music caused political event base argument fact protest definition reaction event protest music caused politics political event exist protested protest music caused politics protest song must protest specific event belief occurred previous music evidenced song provided commentary specific event example bob dylan reacted killing hattie carroll song lonesome death hattie carroll quoted previously case song direct reaction killing hattie carroll killer received six month sentence story came newspaper clipping gordon friesen gave dylan report sentencing sparked dylan song dylan wrote song protest event also larger problem racism corruption justice system case event used example larger societal problem thing protested happened previous composition song direct cause dylan writing song another example song reacting specific event byrd friend mine commented president kennedy assassination saying friend mine killing purpose reason rhyme dallas town gunner shot song reaction death jfk slow solemn tone song portrayal president friend make sympathetic mournful depiction president political stance case song direct reaction event assassination president kennedy would written assassination taken place politics caused protest music protest music must protest specific previous event must also dependent existence political event political event happened protest song could written example kent state shooting crosby still nash young wrote song ohio discussed shooting four student killed state troop culmination nationwide student protest describing fallout event protester point view tin soldier nixon coming finally summer hear drumming four dead ohio got get soldier cutting fact state trooper fired protester profoundly shocking political protester creator protest music showed government firmly supportive thing student protesting willing kill maintain social order reflected song declares soldier cutting ultimately kent state shooting combined reelection richard nixon begin decline protest movement event made clear protest would met armed resistance could end death addition nixon reelection made unlikely protester would make much progress politically show individual political event inspired protest song reacted specific event showed change belief would occurred political event happened challenging view causality politics protest music protest music caused political event argues protest music caused shift political belief audience change belief made musical audience opposed later political event like vietnam war draft turn led political event like student protest tension war argument relies three main point first protest music voiced argued change political belief different belief held majority society second protest music succeeded persuading audience belief third change belief led disagreement political event followed tension led political climate political event like student protest protest music unique among form popular music time purpose voice political belief importantly political belief voiced song different opposition primary political belief time political belief song protested generally classified held older generation especially people running government societal institution bob dylan exemplifies generational split time changin saying criticize understand son daughter beyond command time changin song embodies change political belief speaking directly older generation warning changing time affect everyone power society whole also deepens perceived difference belief going far say older generation even capable understanding view younger generation song also us assumption used protest music older generation synonymous power oppose protest younger generation generational split also shown jefferson airplane volunteer song one radical advocate social change arguing violent overthrow older generation power one generation got old one generation got soul come marching sea got revolution got revolution take volunteer america show split political belief broad require overthrow current social order order promote belief song also advocate social change connection belief set forth jefferson airplane song like white rabbit discussed drug use plastic fantastic lover criticized fake plastic nature society song exemplify split belief power writing protest music arguing change even overthrow power show protest music would delivered message advocating change political belief however music would effect political event message put forth affected belief listener way protest music put forth view politics society opposed belief generally accepted society also succeeded persuading audience belief shown le song instead reception example barry mcguire eve destruction mentioned previously protested nuclear proliferation vietnam war old enough kill votin believe war gun totin believe eve destruction button pushed runnin away one save world grave song clearly rather pessimistically declares humanity eve destruction threat nuclear war song voice basic pacifist complaint regarding post atomic world belief also shared member political protest group meant political message song would viewed favorably audience addition song reached number one meaning would wide distribution large amount radio play message would widely known importantly song present political message obvious clear way meaning would harder miss meaning song listening mean song message would favorable many reach degree popularity another factor determining effect protest song political message would degree politics discussed would affected life audience member gave many song discussing war pacifism greater importance audience vietnam war progressed young people made musical audience drafted sent fight majority protest music argued war unnecessary draft unfair view would sympathetic people drafted example bob dylan discus war control master war saying fasten trigger others fire hide mansion young people blood flow body buried mud dylan protest master war engineer war profit disregarding violence death cause although protest generally nature war message would become important vietnam war progressed song released draft widely instituted sentiment would become important vietnam war led greater number young people drafted fight vietnam case idea put forth song released political event vietnam war use draft sparked political sentiment fueled protest war draft show protest song helped influence political belief audience affected way reacted subsequent political event protest music succeeded changing political belief audience listener greater disagreement political event followed disagreement characterized political climate whole led event like reaction draft student protest tension protest music audience exemplified song like jefferson airplane volunteer discussed tom paxton blue sinister song give dystopic portrayal controlling society painting picture society expects specific belief action willing resort violent mean maintain expectation got slot fill fill slot learn love break take whip line broken heart broken head arranged arranged show artist making protest music viewed society government coercive despotic belief would put direct opposition everything government society well existence current government view society government fueled much reaction part protester especially student protest seen university time period view protester shown many song vietnam war draft especially country joe fish feel like fixin die rag discussed previously fighting ask give damn next stop vietnam voice protester belief war meaningless unnecessary opposes government society wanted fight vietnam however song nihilistic quality country joe also brought spirit protest woodstock feel like fixin die rag grimly pertinent released two year ago said great deal mood changed earlier period hopefulness sobriety newport march washington replaced bitter despair ebullient self indulgence protested war still convinced anything protester would effect protest music succeeded producing music changed political belief audience ideological change led greater tension audience action government resulted tension expressed widespread student protest protest music written topic like war pacifism successfully caused political event like reaction draft showing protest music brought political climate time political event like vietnam war coincided large movement protest music artist writing protest song wrote music popular previous protest artist larger impact political event like vietnam war draft protest music closely related must role causing propagating two main argument regarding either political event caused protest music giving musician something protest protest music caused political event like student protest influencing political climate event like student protest happened however case line causality blurred argued music caused politics political event caused protest music example song like barry mcguire eve destruction used argue theory song protest threat nuclear war mention button pushed runnin away show direct protest existence nuclear bomb threat nuclear warfare support first theory political event case invention nuclear bomb caused protest song however song successful long stint top chart show song would heard many people song like would shifted public opinion toward pacifism would heightened public awareness possibility nuclear warfare effect shifting public opinion military venture like vietnam war would led political event like student protest way nearly every protest song used argue theory case protest music political event closely tied one
