Yeah, I know, he's been a good friend of mine
But lately something's changed that ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl, and I wanna make her mine


And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body
I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night


You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?


I'll play along with this charade
That doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell her that I love her, but the point is probably moot

Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?


Tell me where can I find a woman like that?

Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times, it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive


It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all
With the eye of the tiger


Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive

Does she walk? Does she talk? Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes no one could ever stain
The memory of my angel could never cause me pain


Years go by
I'm lookin' through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in-between

I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round


People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (Oh-oh), hey-ey


Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hoo)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)


For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

She's got a smile that it seems, to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then, when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry


Woah-woah-woah
Sweet child of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet love of mine



She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Sweet child
Sweet child of mine77EmbedWhen you called me up this morning, told me 'bout the new love you found
I said, "I'm happy for you, I'm really happy for you"
Found someone else, I guess I won't be coming 'round
I guess it's over, baby, it's really over, baby, woah
And from what you said, I know you've gotten over me
It'll never be the way it used to be
So if it's gotta be this way
Don't worry, baby, I can take the news okay


But if you see me walking by and the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
And if we meet on the streets someday and I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way


When we both agreed as lovers we were better off as friends
That's how it had to be, yeah, that's how it had to be
I tell you I'm fine, but sometimes I just pretend
Wish you were holding me, wish you were still holding me, woah
I just never thought that I would be replaced so soon
I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you
I know I wanted to be free
Yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be

What is this, a blizzard, that I can't have money in my pocket
And people not talk about me?

In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did?
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you, though I tried
But I guess that's why they say


Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn, yeah, it does


I listen to our favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say, "Love's a game of easy come
And easy go"
But I wonder, does he know?
Has he ever felt like this?
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow, I guess
You might also like
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn


Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains


I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of making love
We both made our separate ways
And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife, I guess


Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn17EmbedLost in a dream
I don't know which way to go
(Ah-let me say it now)
If you are all that you seem
Then baby, I'm movin' (Movin') way too slow


I've been a fool before
Wouldn't like to get my love caught in the slammin' door
How about some information, please?


Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh, oh, oh)
Or am I caught in a hit-and-run?
Straight up, now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together? (Oh, oh, oh)
Or are you just havin' fun?


Time's standing still
Waiting for some small clue
(Ah-let me tell ya now)

You are so hard to read
You play hide-and-seek
With your true intentions
If you're only playin' games
I'll just have to say

But the word and the deed go hand in hand
How about some information, please?

That's the pain I feel
I feel whenever we're apart
Not to say that I'm in love with you
But who's to say that I'm not
I just know that it feels wrong
When I'm away too long
It makes my body hot
So let me tell ya baby
