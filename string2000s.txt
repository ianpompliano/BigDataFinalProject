It's already coming in
Oh, and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it
Unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why
But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return


He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

You're waiting for someone to push you away

And watch it unwind

And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for


Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away the
Anger of angels who won't return

"I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows"
Also, wir bleiben safe bei diesem One-Take-Ding?
"If I fail, if I succeed"
Okay!
"At least I'll live as I believe"
Ah, yeah!
"No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity"

"Because the grea‚Äî"


Keiner lacht mehr, Mama, ich war beim Notar, Mama
GmbH, Mama, ich glaub', ich brauch' 'ne Havanna
Zwei Jahre lang kein Lebenszeichen
Ich hab' gewartet wie ein kleines Kind am Zebrastreifen
Weil ich dacht', so Business-Sachen sind wie Wissenschaften
Bis ich verstanden hab': Ich muss nur ein paar Schritte machen
Und endlich alle andern sich nach mir richten lassen
Von nun an nur noch Bling-Bling und Cristal-Flaschen
Doch bevor wir so weit sind, sammeln Gerichte Akten
Bullen st√ºrmen die Hotelsuite, um mich zu fassen
Ich tausche ein paar Bitches gegen ein paar Mitinsassen
Yeah, ich sch√§tze, sowas nennt man ‚ÄûLicht und Schatten‚Äú
Nach nur acht Stunden wieder frei, danke Gott!
Doch das Ganze hat Haken wie ein Angel-Shop
Andre Leute gehen Sonntag fr√ºh zum Gottesdienst
Bei mir steh'n Fotografen vor dem Haus, ich seh' das objektiv
Als die beiden mit dem Streit in jeder Zeitung sind
K√§mpfen sie ums Recht auf Shindy, als w√§r' ich ein Scheidungskind
Jeder will den Krieg gewinn'n, ich wurd' zum Matchball
Ab da wusst' ich, dieses Spielchen wird zum Rechtsfall
Ich sag': ‚ÄûIch will raus‚Äú, aber man l√§sst mich nicht
Ich sag': ‚ÄûIch zahl' euch aus‚Äú, aber man l√§sst mich nicht
Pl√∂tzlich reichen die Probleme bis nach Bietigheim
Bis vor die Haust√ºr, ich muss nicht weiter ausf√ºhr'n
Cops woll'n ein Statement, BILD will ein Statement
Doch ich red' lieber mit 'ner MILF √ºber Spray-Tan
Fick aufs Spotlight, Accounts offline
Kein Output, daf√ºr Bauschutt
Stell' ein Studio hin, wo ich das erste Mal gekifft hab'
Vier Leute teilen eine Zwei-Liter-Schwip-Schwap
Damit zuhause keiner etwas riecht, essen wir Tic Tac
Jetzt sitz' ich hier auf Samtsofas und so Schnickschnack
Persische Teppiche, √úberwachungsmonitor wie Scarface
Noch immer Hotels und Heartbreaks
Labels renn'n mir hinterher, ich kann alles haben
Ob ich Million√§r bin, musst du Alex fragen
Ich bleib' ein Kind, er macht das Business mit sein'n Assistenten
Hasse nicht Erwachsensein, hass' nur, wie Erwachsne denken
Alles, was ich will, ist 100k im Monat Taschengeld
Eine Patek, einen Phantom und 'ne Mademoiselle
Manchmal schmeckt das Leben wie ein Obstragout
Manchmal kriegt jeder, der dir helfen will, 'nen Drohanruf
Manchmal wird die Rolex von dei'm Vater aus dei'm Haus geklaut
Und manchmal willst du gar nicht wissen, wer es war
Ich kann das niemals meiner Mutter erz√§hl'n
Oder dass zehntausend Euro aus der Schublade fehl'n, yeah
Das ist das Gef√ºhl, wenn du nicht wei√üt, wem du vertrau'n kannst
Ich w√ºnscht', wir w√§r'n wie damals jetzt, mit Alkopops vor Kaufland
ID auf den brandneuen Nikes
Ich bin Ice-T, wie die Zeit fliegt
Vor sechs Jahr'n exmatrikuliert
Doch in sechs Jahr'n mehr gelernt, als h√§tt' ich sechs Jahre studiert, yeah
Ich hab' dich letztens noch geseh'n in deiner schei√ü Karre
An der Kreuzung bei McDonald's, Polizeiwache
Du dachtest damals, du wirst NBA-Pro
Guck auf die Day-Date, Bro, den Rolls-Royce Wraith, Bro
Wer ballt jetzt, Junge? Ich hol' den Rebound
Seh' fresher aus als damals mein Profilbild bei GreekTown
Du sahst aus, als w√ºrd' dich dein Beamtenalltag reizen
Danke f√ºr die beste rote Ampel aller Zeiten
Ich wei√ü noch fr√ºher, gro√üe Pause, Raucherstein
Alles, was ich wollte, war da stehen und genauso sein
Carhartt Beanies, Osiris D3s
Wei√üe Dickies-Sweater, Riot-City-Rapper
Jetzt ist euer Leben nur noch Zweitliga, ah
Jeden Tag nine-to-five Minesweeper, ah
Damals hie√ü es, ‚ÄûOpen-Mic, nur Shindy kann nicht rein!‚Äú
Heute hei√üt es, ‚ÄûEy, du bist doch Shindy, kann das sein?‚Äú
Ich schei√ü' auf eure Riot-City-Jams
Ich bin immer noch Bissingens 50 Cent
Ich steh' morgens dann auf, wenn ich will
Und piss' auf meine alte Schule von mei'm Haus in den Hills, eh
Ich lach' jetzt, Mama, haha, Mama
Die schaufeln mir kein Grab, die bau'n mir eine Grabkammer
Papa meinte, er ist stolz, in meinem Traum neulich
Wir hab'n nicht viel gemeinsam, aber ich war lange blau√§ugig
Ich dachte, so Intrigen gibt's nur in 'ner Daily-Soap
Oder irgendwelchen Serien von HBO
Alle selbsts√ºchtig, auf die harte Art gelernt
Dass es keine Freunde gibt, sobald das Geld mitmischt
Paradox, dass wir das Label ‚ÄûFriends with Money‚Äú nenn'n
Was soll ich sagen? Der holt 'n Rolls-Royce Cullinan
Das war ein Dilemma, so wie Nelly featuring Kelly Rowland
Eh, doch ich bin back f√ºr meinen Magic-Moment
Den ganzen Tag im Studio wie ein Vocalcoach
Das ist kein Comeback, ich nenn' das Road to GOAT
Geh und richt es deinen Freunden aus, sch√∂ne Gr√º√üe
Keine Pilotenbrille, doch es folgen H√∂henfl√ºge
Nur paar Dinge, die rausmussten
Drip ‚Äì Vorsicht, nicht ausrutschen, ah!You might also like2EmbedSo lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face


If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?


If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go


And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days


If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then, I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time


If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go


If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go
I'll go wherever you will go31Embed

Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you, guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt


The feeling that I'm feeling now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here, 'cause, baby (We belong together)

You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face, in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you


Yeah, she caught my eye, as I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was, fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end

I couldn't control her
So lucky oh me, I was just like a clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster, she showed her

Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweatpants and the Reeboks with the straps (With the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (Ayy!)
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low


Whoa, shawty
Yeah, she was worth the money
Lil' mama took my cash and I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back, got her them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack, I had to handle that
I was on it, sexy woman
Let me showin' and made me want it
Two in the mornin', I'm zonin' and them Ros bottles foamin'
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fly just like my Glock


Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur)

Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen, ooh
But somethin' happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found somethin' true
And everyone's lookin' 'round thinkin' I'm going crazy
Ooh, yeah


But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
You cut me open and I


Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
You might also like
Mm, yeah


Tryin' hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercin' sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from fallin', ooh, yeah
But nothin's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe


But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
You cut me open and I


Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open, mmh

And it's drainin' all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearin' these scars for everyone to see


I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
Ooh, you cut me open and I


Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love (You)
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
Oh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love (You)

Ooh, you cut me open and I

Hey33EmbedI just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better


You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright


No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

And my heart is hurting
You will always be around

Can get in the way of what I feel


I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide, something so real
So 'til the end of time, I'm telling you there ain't


No one, no one, no one

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know


That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said


Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"


So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
You might also like
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go," and I said


Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"


Oh, oh


But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said


"Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'"

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you178Embed
